# Plasticity-Code
This repositories was created to share additional codes for my plasticity model. The code is written in C#.Net and it requires Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 which could be downloaded for free.

Additional codes provide below:

1. Iterative method to calculate out of roundness eccentricity used in [1-2]. Folder: EccentricityACI.
2. Iterative method to calculate out of roundness eccentricity. (New Formulation...). Folder: Eccentricity.
